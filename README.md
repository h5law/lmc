# Little Minion Computer

üìå **LMC** or **L**ittle **M**inion **C**omputer is a toy example of a machine architecture

**NOTE:** The LMC uses decimal arithmetic **not** binary arithmetic

## Design

![LMC High Level Design](./lmc-design.png "LMC High Level Design")

### Mailboxes

- Mailboxes = Registers
- 2-digit address space
    - 100 ‚Äúmailboxes‚Äù in total
- Each ‚Äúmailbox‚Äù contains a "slip of paper" with 3-digits on it

### Calculator

- Calculator = CPU
- Operates on 3-digit numbers
    - Add, subtract
    - Has 1 flag
        - NEG
        - Indicates whether a subtraction caused a negative number

### 2-digit Counter

- 2-digit counter = program counter
- has 2 buttons on it
    - first button increments the counter by 1
        - operated internally by the minion
    - second button resets the counter to 00
        - operated externally by the user

### Input and Output Trays

- The user can put slips of paper with 3 digits on them into the input tray
    - these are to be read when the little minion next looks at the tray
- The little minion can write 3 digits on a slip of paper and put them in the out tray
    - these are to be read by the user

## Workflow

The little minion controlling the computer follows the steps listed below:

1. Starts by looking at the counter for a mailbox address (xx)

2. The minion then increments the counter by 1

3. The minion goes to the mailbox xx and reads what is written there

    a. reads 3 digits

4. The minion takes the appropriate action depending on those digits

5. Back to step (1)

üìå This is the **fetch and execute cycle**

## Instruction Set

The little minion will read from the 3-digit number on the slip in the mailbox it was sent to, these are ********op-codes******** and instruct the little minion as to what to do.

### ****************Op Codes****************

- **LOAD (op-code 5)**
    - Instruction `5xx`
        - goto mailbox address `xx` and load the 3-digit number into the calculator
    - This is a copy and does not overwrite the mailbox `xx`
- **STORE (op-code 3)**
    - Instruction `3xx`
        - goto the calculator and read the 3-digit number displayed
        - goto mailbox address `xx` and set its contents to be the 3-digit number from the calculator
    - This is a copy and does not overwrite the calculator
- **ADD (op-code 1)**
    - Instruction `1xx`
        - goto the mailbox address `xx` and read the 3-digit number stored there
        - goto the calculator and add the number to the number already on the calculator
- **SUBTRACT (op-code 2)**
    - Instruction `2xx`
        - goto the mailbox address `xx` and read the 3-digit number stored there
        - goto the calculator and subtract the number from the number already on the calculator
        - If the number read from memory address `xx` is larger than the current number in the calculator then raise the `NEG` flag
- **I/O (op-codes 901 and 902)**
    - Instruction `901` (**READ**)
        - goto the `IN` tray read the 3-digit number there
        - goto the calculator and enter that number in
    - Instruction `902` (**WRITE**)
        - goto the calculator and read the 3-digit number there
        - goto the `OUT` tray and leave a slip of paper with that number on it
- **BREAK (op-code 000)**
    - Instruction `000`
        - the little minion rests
- **BRANCH (op-code 6)**
    - Instruction `6xx`
        - set the 2-digit counter to the value `xx`
        - start fetch of the execution
        - **unconditional branch**
- **BRANCH on ZERO (op-code 7)**
    - Instruction `7xx`
        - goto the calculator and read the value
            - if zero continue
            - if not zero do nothing else
        - set the 2-digit counter to the value `xx`
        - start fetch of the execution
        - **conditional branch**
- **BRANCH on POSITIVE (op-code 8)**
    - Instruction `8xx`
        - goto the calculator and read the value
            - if `NEG` flag is on continue
            - if `NEG` flag is not present do nothing else
        - set the 2-digit counter to the value `xx`
        - start fetch of the execution
        - **conditional branch**

## Calulcator

In the LMC **all** actions go through the calculator

- To output the value stored in mailbox address `xx`
    - `5xx`
    - `902`
- To read from the input and write to the mailbox address `xx`
    - `901`
    - `3xx`
- To add the values stored in mailbox addresses `xx` and `yy` and store this in `xx`
    - `5xx`
    - `1yy`
    - `3xx`

## Fetch and Execute

The steps taken by the little minion are called the **instruction cycle**. The instruction cycle has 2 stages:

- **********Fetch**********
    - the little minion finds the instruction to execute
        - the minion goes to the counter
        - reads the address there (and then increments it to be ready for the next cycle)
        - the minion goes to the mailbox at that address and reads the 3-digit number in the mailbox
- ********Execute********
    - the little minion performs the work specified in the instruction
